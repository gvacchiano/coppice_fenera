## Aim ##
Understanding the drivers of sprouting following coppicing in sweet chestnut stands. For example, we hypothesize that larger, older stools would sprout less or not at all, as also stools with mostly dead shoots. Also, leaving one shoot on the stool should have a beneficial effect on the probability of sprouting. 

## Study area ##
[SCI Monte Fenera](https://goo.gl/maps/b1XNvoymHXA2), Valduggia (VC), Italy

## Experimental design ##
Five hectares of coppice with dominant sweet chestnut (_Castanea sativa_ Miller) and sporadic oak (_Quercus robur_ L.) and birch (_Betula pendula_ L.) were subject in February-March 2018 to experimental management. Three hectares were coppiced according to traditional practice and 20% residual forest cover was retained. In the other two hectares all chestnut trees were cut and only other species were retained.

## Field measurements ##
200 stools were monitored for five years after the cut and measured for:

1. number and vitality of sprouts
2. height of tallest sprout
3. number and vitality of shoots before cutting
4. number and vitality of shoots retained from cutting
5. diameter of shoots and stool-base before cutting
6. age of shoots before cutting
7. quality of the cut surface (height, regularity, angle)
8. microtopography 
9. distance to 5 closest live stools

The depth of soil available to roots will be also sampled across the study area.

## Analysis ##

GLM and GAM for the probability of sprouting (yes/no) and height of maximum sprout as a function of all dependent variables.
